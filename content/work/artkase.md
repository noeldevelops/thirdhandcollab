This artist portfolio site is a WordPress “Custom Child Theme” - this means that we chose a template from <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/"> https://wordpress.org/themes/</a> and I coded small changes like custom fonts, colors, and animations. <!--more-->I also helped with domain registration, choosing a hosting account, and site set up (including Wordpress installation, theme selection, uploading images).
