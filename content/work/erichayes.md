This site is meant to be all about dramatic images - itâ€™s theatre actor & director's online resume and portfolio. It has back-end functionality that makes very easy for him to update and add productions, festivals, and images. <!--more-->Besides handling design and development, I also helped with choosing a hosting account, site set up, and training the client on how to make the most of it.
